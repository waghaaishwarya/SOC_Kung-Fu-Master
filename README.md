# SOC'25 : Building an RL Agent : Kungfu Master

Progress made so far:
- Dived deeper into scientific computing libraries such as: Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib in Python
- Understood basics of **Linear Programming**, including matrix form representation and solving with Pythonâ€™s pulp library.
- Introduced to **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** concepts through videos and articles.
- Studied **Multi-Armed Bandits**, focusing on:
  - Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm  
  - Thompson Sampling  
  - Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)  
  - Key comparisons and formal understanding 
- Currently exploring **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** : structure, components, and solution approaches.
